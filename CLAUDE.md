# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Chrome Extension (Manifest V3) that enables AI-powered browser automation via a side panel chat interface. The AI agent can navigate pages, click elements, type text, execute JavaScript, and interact with the DOM. The LLM API (DeepSeek, OpenAI, or a local model) is called **directly from the Service Worker via `fetch`** — there is no Native Messaging Host.

## Development

No build step is required. This is vanilla JavaScript loaded directly into Chrome.

**To run/test:** Open `chrome://extensions`, enable Developer Mode, click "Load unpacked", and select this directory. After code changes, click the refresh icon on the extension card.

**Minimum Chrome:** 114

## Architecture

The extension has three runtime components that communicate via `chrome.runtime.sendMessage`:

### `background.js` — Service Worker (core)
The heart of the extension. Manages:
- **LLM API calls** via `fetch` directly from the Service Worker (no external host)
- **Chat loop**: sends messages → receives tool calls → executes tools → feeds results back
- **27 browser automation tools** defined in `BROWSER_TOOLS` (navigation, DOM reading, interaction, export, screenshot, dialog handling, waits)
- **Vision support**: screenshot images are forwarded to the LLM only for vision-capable OpenAI models (`gpt-4o`, `gpt-4.1`, `o1`–`o5`, etc.); non-vision models receive a text fallback
- **Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP)** via the `debugger` API for JS evaluation and console capture
- **Approval system**: sensitive actions (`navigate`, `click_element`, `type_text`, `evaluate_js`, `select_option`) require user confirmation with a 3-minute expiry window; skip in `auto` mode
- **Retry/backoff**: `callLLM` retries up to 3× on HTTP 429 or 5xx with exponential backoff (1 s → 2 s → 4 s)
- **Session state**: nonce, pending approvals, DevTools attachment status, conversation history (capped at 60 msgs; trim always starts at a `user` message to avoid orphaned `tool` roles)

Message types it handles: `agentic.chat`, `agentic.command`, `agentic.config.*`, `agentic.approval.*`, `agentic.handshake`, `agentic.stop`, `agentic.reload`, `agentic.status`

### `sidepanel.js` / `sidepanel.html` — Chat UI
Renders the conversation, sends user messages to the background, displays approval prompts, and shows connection status. Uses a nonce-based SHA-256 handshake with the background worker for sender verification. Includes a lightweight Markdown renderer.

### `settings.js` / `settings.html` — Configuration UI
Persists to `chrome.storage.local`: `provider`, `apiEndpoint`, `apiKey`, `model`, `customModel`, `thinkingEnabled`, `systemPrompt`, `permissionMode`. Three provider presets: DeepSeek (default), OpenAI (`gpt-4o` default), LM Studio (local).

### Data Flow
```
User → sidepanel.js → background.js ──fetch──► LLM API
                              │
                    Chrome Tabs / CDP / scripting API
                              │
               Approval system → back to sidepanel.js
```

## Key Permissions (manifest.json)

`debugger`, `downloads`, `scripting`, `tabs`, `tabGroups`, `sidePanel`, `storage`, `unlimitedStorage`, `<all_urls>` (host permission)

> **Note:** `nativeMessaging` is NOT used — the extension calls the LLM directly.

## Security Model

- Nonce + SHA-256 handshake between sidepanel and background worker
- Sender validation checks extension ID on all messages
- Approval/rejection gate on sensitive actions (3-minute expiry, tracked by `transactionId`)
- HTML escaping in sidepanel to prevent XSS from LLM output
- `evaluate_js` fallback uses `Function` constructor before `eval` to limit local scope leakage

## Project Skills

Skills are instruction sets that Claude loads to improve performance on specialized tasks. This project bundles two skills under `.claude/skills/` so any agent working in this directory can use them automatically.

### Installed skills

| Skill | Directory | When to use |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| **webapp-testing** | `.claude/skills/webapp-testing/` | Testing `sidepanel.html` and `settings.html` with Playwright (UI verification, screenshot diff, element discovery). Uses `file://` URLs — no server required for static HTML pages. |
| **frontend-design** | `.claude/skills/frontend-design/` | Redesigning or improving the extension UI. Provides opinionated guidelines for typography, color, motion, and layout to avoid generic aesthetics. |

> **Note:** The `claude-api` skill (LLM API integration patterns) is available globally via the Claude Code plugin system and does not need to be bundled here. Install it with `/plugin install claude-api@anthropic-agent-skills` if not already present.

### Installing additional skills from anthropics/skills

To install more skills from the upstream Anthropic repository:

```
# Register the marketplace (one-time)
/plugin marketplace add anthropics/skills

# Install skill bundles
/plugin install example-skills@anthropic-agent-skills   # webapp-testing, frontend-design, mcp-builder, etc.
/plugin install document-skills@anthropic-agent-skills  # xlsx, docx, pptx, pdf
/plugin install claude-api@anthropic-agent-skills       # Claude/Anthropic SDK patterns
```

Skills installed via `/plugin` are global to Claude Code. The ones in `.claude/skills/` are project-scoped and committed to the repo so all agents and contributors get them automatically.

### Adding a new project skill

1. Create `.claude/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` with YAML frontmatter (`name`, `description` fields required).
2. Add any supporting scripts to `.claude/skills/<skill-name>/scripts/`.
3. Document it in the table above.

## Changelog (improvements applied 2026-05-27)

| # | File | Change |
|---|------|--------|
| 1 | `background.js` | `VISION_MODELS` expanded: added `gpt-4.1`, `o2`, `o5` |
| 2 | `background.js` | `callLLM` now retries 3× with exponential backoff on 429/5xx |
| 3 | `background.js` | `see_screen` returns a text error for non-vision models instead of capturing a base64 screenshot that would be discarded |
| 4 | `background.js` | `evaluateOnPage` fallback: tries `Function` constructor first; falls back to `eval` only for statement-style expressions |
| 5 | `background.js` | History trim now finds the first `user` message after slicing to avoid orphaned `tool` role messages that break the API contract |
| 6 | `settings.js` | OpenAI preset model corrected from non-existent `gpt-5.4-nano` to `gpt-4o` |
| 7 | `CLAUDE.md` | Removed outdated Native Messaging Host references; corrected permissions list; documented all improvements |
